# Dokkut

A terminal dashboard for Dokku

### Why?

Dokku is a fantastic PaaS, but it's only CLI. This is great if you are familiar with it, and you know what to do.
Unfortunately, because I actually interact with Dokku sporadically, I forget a lot of the commands and how to do things.

There are a couple of web-based dashboard, but--currently--they are pretty dated. Having a web dashboard also adds at least one layer and requires more setup.

Dokkut tries to address both these "issues" by providing an interface directly in the terminal.
